This is a Springboard capstone project that compares multiple machine learning models to make prediction of future month sales. The data used in this project is a challening time-series dataset of daily sales data provided by a large Russian software firm - 1C Company.

The machine learning methods used in this project are Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, and an open-source software released by Facebook, Prophet.

The list of deliverables are introducted below:

Data Acquisition - Obtaining and wrangling of dataset to prepare it for EDA and machine learning
Capstone 2 Exploratory Data Analysis - Exploring the dataset based on its features, such as categories, sales, availability duration, and pricing
Milestone Report - Draft of final report
Random Forests & Gradient Boosting Models - Applying and optimizing of both random forest and gradient boosting regressor models by engineering new features
SARIMA Prediction - Applying and optimizing SARIMA models by using grid search
Facebook Prophet Model - Applying and optimizing Prophet models by using grid search
Model Comparison - Comparing all four models with baseline model of last month's sales.
