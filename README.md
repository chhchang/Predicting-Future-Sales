### Springboard Capstone 2 Project

# Predicting Future Sales

This is a Springboard capstone project that compares multiple machine learning models to make prediction of future month sales. The data used in this project is a challening time-series dataset of daily sales data provided by a large Russian software firm - 1C Company. The data is featured in a Kaggle Challenged: [Predict Future Sales - Final project for "How to win a data science competition" Coursera course](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/data)

The machine learning methods used in this project are **Random Forest Regressor**, **Gradient Boosting**, **Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA)**, and an open-source software released by Facebook, **Prophet**.

The list of deliverables are introducted below:

**Data Acquisition** - Obtaining and wrangling of dataset to prepare it for EDA and machine learning

**Capstone 2 Exploratory Data Analysis** - Exploring the dataset based on its features such as categories, sales, availability duration, and pricing

**Milestone Report** - Draft of final report

**Random Forests & Gradient Boosting Models** - Applying and optimizing of both models with feature engineering 

**SARIMA Prediction** - Applying and optimizing SARIMA models by using grid search

**Facebook Prophet Model** - Applying and optimizing Prophet models by using grid search

**Model Comparison** - Comparing all four models with baseline model of last month's sales.
